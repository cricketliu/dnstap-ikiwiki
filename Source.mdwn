The following code repositories are available.

### [dnstap](https://github.com/dnstap/dnstap)
This is the C library for adding `dnstap` support to a DNS server.

You need this if you're a DNS programmer adding `dnstap` support to a nameserver, or if you're compiling a nameserver with `dnstap` support.

Release tarballs of the library have no extra dependencies, but a `git` checkout requires the [`protobuf-c`](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/) compiler and the `autotools` to be installed, since no generated files are checked in to this repository.

```
$ sudo apt-get install protobuf-c-compiler
$ git clone git://github.com/dnstap/dnstap.git
$ cd dnstap && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install
```

### [dnstap.pb](https://github.com/dnstap/dnstap.pb)
This is the [Protocol Buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) schema defining the layout of `dnstap` payloads. Use this if you want to process `dnstap` payloads in a programming language with `protobuf` support, or if you want to extend the `dnstap` schema to support new event types.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/dnstap/dnstap.pb.git
$ cd dnstap.pb
$ protoc-c --c_out=. dnstap.proto
$ protoc --cpp_out=. dnstap.proto
$ protoc --python_out=. dnstap.proto
$ protoc --go_out=. dnstap.proto
```

### [unbound](https://github.com/dnstap/unbound)
This is [NLNet Labs'](http://nlnetlabs.nl/) [Unbound](http://unbound.net/) recursive DNS server, patched to generate `dnstap` payloads. `dnstap` support is developed on the `branches/dnstap` branch and periodically merged to `master`.

Building Unbound with `dnstap` support requires that the `dnstap` library be installed first, see above. `dnstap` support for Unbound also introduces a build dependency on the `pkg-config` utility.

Two new `./configure` arguments have been added: `--enable-dnstap` to build with `dnstap` support, and `--with-dnstap-socket-path` to set the default `dnstap` socket path.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dnstap/unbound.git
$ cd unbound && ./configure --enable-dnstap && make && sudo make install
```

### [golang-dnstap](https://github.com/dnstap/golang-dnstap)
This is the [Go](http://golang.org/) language library for working with `dnstap` sockets, log files, and message payloads. It also includes a command-line capture tool.

```
# apt-get install golang
$ go get -u github.com/dnstap/golang-dnstap/dnstap
```
