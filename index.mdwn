### Introduction
`dnstap` is a flexible, structured binary log format for DNS software. It uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to encode events that occur inside DNS software in an implementation-neutral format.

Currently `dnstap` can only encode wire-format DNS messages. It is planned to support additional types of DNS log information.

Server-side `dnstap` support is being developed initially for the [Unbound](http://unbound.net/) recursive DNS server. It is planned to develop `dnstap` support for additional DNS servers and other kinds of DNS software.

A standalone command-line tool for receiving and decoding `dnstap` log messages is also being worked on. Check out [this example output](https://gist.github.com/edmonds/5772879) from the `dnstap` command to get an idea of the kind of information that `dnstap` can encode.

The current development trees can be found on the [[Source]] page.
