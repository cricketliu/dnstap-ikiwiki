### Introduction
`dnstap` adds a fast, binary format event stream directly into DNS servers. It uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to encode events that occur inside a nameserver in a vendor-neutral format. Currently `dnstap` can only encode the reception and transmission of wire-format DNS messages. Server-side `dnstap` support is being developed initially for the [Unbound](http://unbound.net/) recursive DNS server. A command-line tool to receive and decode `dnstap` events is also being worked on.

We plan to define more event types and add support to more DNS servers in the future.

Check out [this example output](https://gist.github.com/edmonds/5772879) from the `dnstap` command-line tool to get an idea of the kind of information that `dnstap` can encode.

### Presentations
A [slide deck](slides/dnstap.html) introducing `dnstap` and giving the current status was presented on June 13, 2013.

### Mailing list
There is a [dnstap mailing list](http://lists.redbarn.org/mailman/listinfo/dnstap) for everyone interested in discussing `dnstap`.
